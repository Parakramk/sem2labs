/*
6. Write a program that manages an array of student objects. Each student object contains a name and age.
The program should prompt the user to enter the number of students and their respective names and ages.
Afterward, calculate and display the average age of all the students. Furthermore, find and print the name of the oldest student in the array.
Provide the code to implement this program, including the necessary class definition and the logic to calculate the average age
and find the oldest student.
